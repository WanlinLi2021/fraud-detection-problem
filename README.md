# Unsupervised learning applied to the fraud detection problem

Credit card payments make up a significant portion of financial transactions worldwide. They offer ease and efficiency unmatched by other payment types, especially for transactions made over the Internet. But with such ubiquity comes opportunities for criminals to commit fraud. 

For this reason, machine learning techniques are increasingly being considered as they allow for much faster fraud detection. Thus, in this work, we study some fraud detection techniques based on unsupervised learning and compare their performance on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection (IEEE-FD) dataset offered on the Kaggle platform. Then, we quickly analyze the IEEE-FD data before presenting the algorithms used.
